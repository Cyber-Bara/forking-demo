# Cargo-Shipment-Management-System
This project is a C++ program that demonstrates the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance. It is designed with a strong emphasis on the SOLID principles - a set of design principles that improve code flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.

# Features
```
Abstraction                                   : Hides complex implementations, exposing only necessary features to the user.

Encapsulation                                 : Controls data access and modification, safeguarding internal states of objects.

Polymorphism                                  : Allows for dynamic method binding, enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class or interface.

Inheritance                                   : Structures the program using class hierarchies, promoting code reuse and logical organization.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)         : Each class has one clear responsibility, making it easy to understand and modify.

Open-Closed Principle (OCP)                   : Classes are designed to be extendable without changing their core functionality.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)           : Subtypes can seamlessly replace their base types without altering program behavior.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)         : Interfaces are tailored to specific client needs, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)          : High-level modules depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.
